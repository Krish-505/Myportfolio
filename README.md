## üöÄ Features

This portfolio is a fully responsive single-page application (SPA) packed with modern features:

*   **Scroll-Based Animations:** Subtle fade-in animations on each section as the user scrolls, implemented with the `react-awesome-reveal` library.
*   **Responsive Design:** A mobile-first approach ensures the site looks and works great on all devices, from mobile phones to widescreen desktops.
*   **Project Showcase:** A clean, grid-based layout to display my projects, complete with images, descriptions, technology tags, and links to the live demo and source code.
*   **Interactive UI:** Smooth scrolling, hover effects, and a sticky navigation bar provide a seamless user experience.
